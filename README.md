**Dictionary**:
A list/array of objects stored in sorted order by name.


**Heap**:

Heaps are used when the highest or lowest order/priority element needs to be removed.
In my project I implemented a max queue, object with highest priority goes to the top.
This allows the time complexity of O(1) when searching since it will always use the first, highest priority in this case.



**Palindrome**:

An object is palindrome when it is the exact same if the object were to be reversed.
Character order front -> back = back -> front

Examples: Is palindrome?
AppA    : true
Banana  : false
Test    : false
bbbbb   : true
